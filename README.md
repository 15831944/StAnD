# StAnD
STructural Analysis and Design (StAnD) program. 

## What is it?
StAnD is a program for linear structural analysis (static/dynamic) of beams, plane and space truss/frames,
shells etc. It can also design reinforced concrete / steel beams and columns using different national codes
including the Ethiopian building codes and standards. 

## History
This is a very old project of mine I started during final year project of my BsC (circa 2003) at 
Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia. The code uses 
Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) to create a GUI that looks like the widely used SAP program. I was extremely
inspired by SAP at the time, and also didn't want to do the structural analysis and design by hand which was 
required for the final year project.

## Dependency
  1. Windows :)
  2. Microsoft C++
  3. Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)
  4. IMSL Fortran numeric library
  5. Arnoldi package (ARPACK) for eigen value analysis.

## Does it work?
It should, but haven't been tested for a long long time.
